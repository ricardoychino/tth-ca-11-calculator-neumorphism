## Treehouse Code Adventures: Digital Calculator Neumorphism

A digital calculator styled in the neumorphism design trend. Implement this design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Basic arithmetic operations should be functional: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The "AC" key should clear the current input and reset the calculator. The decimal point key should allow for calculations with decimal numbers. The equals key should compute the current calculation and display the result.
